            <p class="copy"> On its own the written word means nothing. As long as I stay in the realm of writing, the meaning of the word is not an issue. The minute I concern myself with the meaning of the word I have to do with language. When a child learns to read, the child learns to connect written words with words in language. The problems associated with this are customarily viewed exclusively as a language problem: the child does not understand what is written. In the end it will always come down to that, but if we cannot see what is written, there will be nothing to understand.</p>

			<p class="copy">A child that cannot adequately perceive the word will never learn to read well, because school concentrates attention on comprehension. This is of little use to someone who perceives badly and schooling does nothing about perception. In fact, with its image of the word as a row of letters in a specific sequence, the school gets in the way of a clear view of the written word. Thus reading is replaced by calculation: put the numbers 1, 2, 3 in the correct order. Objectively considered, the sequence 3, 2, 1 is equivalent to the sequence 1, 2, 3, but this correct solution is wrong, because in school only the subjective perspective holds, in which left is always left and right always right. With children who know it can be otherwise, because they move around things, the school is clueless.</p>

 			<p class="copy"> The black partitions between the white intervals may be similar, but they must be equivalent, equal in value, because otherwise they would disrupt the rhythm. When the intervals of a rhythmic ensemble are separated by mutually discrepant figures then those figures are themselves intervals of a rhythmic ensemble. The rhythmic connection of the white shapes in the word is the condition of the rhythm of the black shapes and vice versa. The black shapes of writing are determined and regulated letter by letter and the counterpoint is easily controlled. The white shapes are constituted only in the combination of letters; there is no simple measure of their size and they follow almost incidentally from the black strokes which solicit so much attention. This is why I place so much emphasis on the white shapes in the word.

			<p class="bolder paddy"> In everyday spoken language rhythm means regularity in intervals of time. The intervals are not really equal in size and the same in form, but equal in value, equivalent. Rhythm in writing is not a temporal structure but a spatial matter – the intervals have length, but also breadth.</p> 
            <p class="bolder paddy">The word consists of forms, white and black, which constitute a rhythmic unit. If the rhythm is weak, the word is poorly formed; if the rhythm is absent, there is no word, even if the letters are scattered across the paper in the proper sequence.</p>

            <p class="paddyc copy">Figure 4.1 surveys the significance rhythm has for practice. In 1 the letters are wider than in 3 – the enclosed white is smaller in 3 – the white between the letters must therefore also be smaller. In 2 the, white that is enclosed by the strokes of each letter is also smaller than in I because the stroke is heavier. Hence the letters in 2 also stand closer together than in 1. If I want to make the space between letters as small as possible, then the white forms within the letters must also be as small as possible. In 4 I move in that direction with a narrow letter and a heavy stroke. Figure 4.1 aims to give harmonious word images. The word images are as they should be, which is not a great starting point for an impressive demonstration.</p>

           <p class="paddyc copy"> In figure 4.2 I have scrambled the handling of the letter combinations. This has a more striking effect. In every instance the word image falls apart. In 1 and 2 the small interletter spaces pull the letters apart (the stem of the d relates much more to the first stem of the u than to the bowl of the d); in 3 and 4 the large inter letter spaces push the letters in upon themselves. In 1 and 2 the letters seem too broad, in 3 and 4 they seem too narrow. In 3 and 4 the word has become a row of unrelated letters; in 1 and 2 the chaos is even greater because now the letters themselves are destroyed.
